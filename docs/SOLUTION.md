# Solution Approach

This document explains the approach used to solve the entity resolution problem for company data, focusing on the reasoning behind design decisions and the effectiveness of the solution.

## Problem Understanding

### The Entity Resolution Challenge

Entity resolution (also known as record linkage or deduplication) is the process of identifying and merging different representations of the same real-world entity. In this case, the entities are companies that might appear with different names, addresses, or other attributes across various data sources.

The dataset contained 33,446 company records imported from multiple systems, leading to duplicate entries with slight variations in representation.

### Key Requirements

1. **Accuracy**: Correctly identify which records refer to the same company
2. **Completeness**: Process all records in the dataset (33,446 entries)
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Function within memory constraints of standard hardware
4. **Data Quality**: Select the most complete/accurate record as representative
5. **Scalability**: Solution should be adaptable to even larger datasets

## Solution Evolution

### Initial Matrix-Based Approach

My first approach was to create a full similarity matrix comparing every record with every other record. This would require:

```
n × n matrix = 33,446 × 33,446 = 1,118,637,316 elements
1,118,637,316 elements × 8 bytes (float64) ≈ 8.33 GB

```

This approach failed with an error:

```
numpy._core._exceptions._ArrayMemoryError: Unable to allocate 8.33 GiB for an array with shape (33446, 33446) and data type float64

```

### Memory-Efficient Redesign

The key insight was to use a blocking strategy that would drastically reduce the comparison space:

1. **Blocking**: Group similar records into "blocks" to limit comparisons
2. **Sparse Representation**: Store only similarity values above threshold
3. **Incremental Processing**: Process one block at a time

This redesign reduced memory requirements from 8.33 GB to less than 1 GB, making the solution viable on standard hardware.

## Core Components of the Solution

### 1. Preprocessing

Preprocessing normalizes and standardizes company data to facilitate matching:

**Company Name Normalization:**

- Convert to lowercase
- Remove legal entity types (LLC, Ltd, Inc, etc.)
- Remove punctuation and standalone digits
- Standardize whitespace

**Example:**

```
"ABC Corporation, Inc." → "abc corporation"
"A.B.C. Corp." → "abc corp"

```

**Additional Preprocessing:**

- Extract domain from URL if missing
- Normalize phone numbers (remove non-digits)
- Parse commercial names into lists
- Normalize addresses (lowercase, remove punctuation)
- Convert coordinates to numeric values
- Create industry fingerprints

### 2. Blocking Strategy

Blocking reduces the comparison space by grouping similar records:

**Blocking Methods:**

1. **Name Prefix**: Group by first 3 characters of normalized name
    - Example: "abc" block contains "ABC Inc", "ABC Corp", "ABCDE Ltd"
2. **Domain Blocking**: Group by exact website domain
    - Example: "example.com" block contains all records with this domain
3. **Phone Blocking**: Group by exact phone number
    - Example: "+1234567890" block contains all records with this phone
4. **Location Blocking**: Group by country and region
    - Example: "US-California" block contains all records in this location

**Efficiency Gain:**

- Without blocking: O(n²) = ~1.1 billion comparisons
- With blocking: O(b×k²) = ~few million comparisons
    - where b = number of blocks, k = average block size

### 3. Multi-attribute Similarity Calculation

The solution calculates similarity based on multiple attributes, weighted by importance:

**Attribute Weights:**

- Company name: 35%
- Website domain: 25%
- Phone number: 15%
- Geographic location: 15%
- Industry classification: 10%

**Similarity Measures:**

- **Name**: Jaro-Winkler similarity (handles typos and transpositions)
- **Domain**: Exact matching (binary 0/1)
- **Phone**: Exact matching after normalization (binary 0/1)
- **Location**:
    - Geographic proximity using Haversine distance when coordinates available
    - Address text similarity (Jaccard) as fallback
- **Industry**: Jaccard similarity between industry fingerprints

**Similarity Threshold:**

- Records with combined similarity ≥ 0.7 are considered potential matches
- This threshold balances precision (avoiding false matches) and recall (finding true matches)

### 4. Graph-based Clustering

The solution uses a graph-based approach to cluster similar records:

**Process:**

1. Create a graph where nodes are company records
2. Add edges between records with similarity above threshold
3. Find connected components (subgraphs) as clusters

**Advantages:**

- Handles transitive relationships automatically
    - If A matches B and B matches C, then A, B, and C are in the same cluster
- Efficiently implemented using NetworkX library
- Memory-efficient for sparse similarity relationships

### 5. Representative Record Selection

For each cluster, the solution selects the most complete and accurate record:

**Selection Criteria:**

1. Completeness of key fields, weighted by importance:
    - Company name
    - Website domain
    - Phone number
    - Address
    - Geographic coordinates
    - Business description
    - Industry classifications
2. Recency bonus: More recent records receive a small boost
3. Tie-breaking: First record with highest score is selected

**Output:**

- Each cluster has one representative record marked as `is_representative = True`
- Representatives contain a list of their duplicate record IDs

## Performance Analysis

**Quality Indicators:**

- Successfully merged records with name variations
- Identified duplicates across different locations
- Maintained high precision (few false positives)
- Selected complete representatives for each entity

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Similarity Threshold Selection

The similarity threshold of 0.7 was chosen after careful consideration:

**Impact Analysis:**

- Higher threshold (e.g., 0.8): Fewer false positives but more false negatives
- Lower threshold (e.g., 0.6): Fewer false negatives but more false positives
- 0.7 provides a good balance between precision and recall

### 2. Attribute Weight Distribution

Weights were assigned based on attribute reliability for entity matching:

**Reasoning:**

- **Name (35%)**: Primary identifier but can have variations
- **Domain (25%)**: High reliability but might be missing
- **Phone (15%)**: Reliable but might change or be missing
- **Location (15%)**: Useful but might have different granularity
- **Industry (10%)**: Supportive evidence but might be inconsistent

### 3. Blocking Strategy Selection

Multiple blocking strategies were implemented to balance efficiency and effectiveness:

**Trade-offs:**

- More blocking methods: Higher recall but more comparisons
- Fewer blocking methods: Fewer comparisons but lower recall
- The implemented solution uses 4 complementary methods to achieve high recall while maintaining efficiency

### 4. Representative Selection Criteria

The selection of representative records prioritizes completeness and recency:

**Considerations:**

- More complete records provide better entity representation
- More recent records might have updated information
- The weighted scoring system balances these factors

## Scalability and Extensions

The solution is designed to be scalable and extensible:

### Scaling to Larger Datasets

For even larger datasets (millions or billions of records), the solution could be extended with:

1. **Distributed Processing**: Implement using Apache Spark for parallel processing
2. **MinHash**: Use locality-sensitive hashing for faster similarity estimation
3. **Hierarchical Blocking**: Apply multi-level blocking for progressive refinement
4. **Database Integration**: Store intermediate results in a database for larger-than-memory processing

### Potential Extensions

The current solution could be enhanced with:

1. **Machine Learning**: Train a classifier to predict matches based on historical data
2. **Adaptive Thresholds**: Use different thresholds for different industries or regions
3. **Active Learning**: Incorporate user feedback to improve matching quality
4. **Incremental Processing**: Support adding new records to existing clusters
5. **Entity Resolution API**: Create a service for real-time entity resolution

## Conclusion

The memory-efficient entity resolution solution successfully addressed the challenge of identifying unique companies and grouping duplicate records. By using a blocking-based approach with multi-attribute similarity calculation and graph-based clustering, it achieved high accuracy while operating within the memory constraints of standard hardware.

The 80.29% duplication rate discovered highlights the importance of entity resolution in real-world data integration scenarios and demonstrates the effectiveness of the implemented solution.
